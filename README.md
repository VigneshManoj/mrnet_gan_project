Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  of  the  knee uses  a magnetic  field,  radio  waves  and  a  computer  to  produce detailed  pictures  of  the  structures  within  the  knee  joint.  It can be used to help with the diagnosis, weakness, swelling, or evaluate pain in the joint. Determining which sequences/images are to be used for a proper diagnosis need careful  research  and  expertise.  Deep  learning  model  like Generative    Adversarial    Networks    (GANs)    and    their extensions have provided many exciting ways to tackle such problems   to   a   great   extent   with   various   de-noising, reconstruction, segmentation, data simulation, detection and classification techniques. Also, we could use these models to alert the radiologists and physicians based on the severity of the  condition  thereby  reducing  the  workload  in  radiology and  help  in  providing  on  time  diagnosis  and  treatment.So here  we    propose  the  use  of  a  few  deep  learning  models  to help us with the classification of the  MR images to one of the three  categories:abnormalities,  ACL  tears  and  meniscal tears.Our first step wasto performthe image classification using Resnet. We then used DCGAN to generate the images and  its  discriminator  to  classify  the  imagesas  real  or  fake. We were successful in classifyingthe abnormalities in axial images  with  good  accuracy  and able  to  train  the  DCGAN model with downsampled and upsampled images
